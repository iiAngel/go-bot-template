# go-bot-template
GoLang Discord bot template using **discordgo**

## How to run
Before doing anything make sure to use the same **discordgo** version as the one used in this project, unless there is already a release after `v0.28.1`

Make sure you have a `.env` file with the following keys: `BOT_TOKEN` `BOT_CLIENT_ID`.

Then in a terminal run:
```bash
go run .
```
